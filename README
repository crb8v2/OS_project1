Exercise 3.8-8 on page 87 of the UNIX book

This program creates n forks and has each fork read characters from std input 
	into a buffer and terminates. Confusion ensues, as it should. The
	children all race for the input, as there is not a std input for each
	child.



SYNTAX:
-h  	help menu
-p  	test perror
-n int int	, (number of forks) (nchars)

	nchars is the buffer size

make	builds and creates exectuable 'ass1'
make clean	cleans object files and executables




While learning to use version control on github, I created a monster I did
	not know how to undo. The following is the repository for the first
	half of my project:
    		https://github.com/crb8v2/4760_os_project1


The following is the second repository containing the second half,
	and final copy of my project:
    		https://github.com/crb8v2/OS_project1


Final thoughts:
	I thought this was a good project to get back into the
	the semester with C. This was first time I had ever used
	the command line to push to github, as apposed to using just
	git. I do have a few specific questions you may be able to help
	with sometime. The book instructions were a bit confusing.
	Starting from the basics with forks help be gain a, hopefully,
	strong understanding for the rest of the semester.
